## Workers

Like the queen they are also produced by the fertilised egg laid by the queen and live in a chamber called as 'Workers Cell'.
It takes 21 days in the development from the egg to the adult, and the total life span of a worker in about 6 weeks.
The workers are atrophied female which sacrifice themselves for the well-being of the colony.
The indoor and the outdoor duties of the colony are performed by the workers only.
That is why they are provided with same special structures for the particular work.
1. Long proboscis for sucking the nectar.
2. Strong wings for fanning.
3. Pollen Baskets for the collection of pollen.
4. Powerful sting to defend the colony against any attack.
5. Wax gland for the wax secretion.

The workers which are engaged in outdoor duties, collect the nector, pollen, gum and water which are recieved and stored properly by the house bees.
The indoor workers are further sub-grouped for specific duties.
<br>**Nursary Bees**: Some which are very sincere, attend the queen while some others look after the nursary called the nursary bees.
<br>**Builder**: produce wax for formation of the new hive.
<br>**Repairers**: repairs the combs.
<br>**Cleaner**: remove the dead bodied.
<br>**Fanners**: fan the hive with their wings.
<br>**Gaurds**: watch the gateway.<br>
It is said half of the life workers perform the indoor duties and later they are engaged in outdoor ones.

## Drone

The drone is the male member of the honey bee colony which fertilises the queen so called KING of the colony.
They take 24 days to develop from the egg to the adult stage.
The sting and the wax glands are absent but in the males the reproductive organs are very well developed.
They develop from an unfertilised egg in a large DRONE CELL.
Drone are totally dependent on the workers and have been seen begging for honey from the workers.
The sole duty of the drone is to fertilise the virgin queen,.
At the time of swarming the drone follows the queen, copulates and dies after copulation.

## Life History

After mateing the queen generally lays one egg in one brood cell. the eggs are pinkish coloured, elongated with cylinderical body generalyy attached to the bottom of the cell..
Larvae emerge out from the unfertilised eggs forms the drones while workers sre developed from fertilised eggs.
Amongst the larvae of the workers one is fed on the royal jelly, a special diet secreted by the young workers in the colony, and becomes the queen of the colony.
The royal jelly consists of the digested honey and pollen, mixed with a glandular secretion into the mouth of workers. After 5 days of feeding the cell is sealed and the larvae undergo pupation. It spins a thin silken cocoon and pupated completly. Emergence of the young ones takes place after three weeks and they get busy in the indoor duties for about 2 to 3 weeks. Later on they are send for the outdoor duties. All the bees pass through a complete metamorphosis with the various changes in the life-cycle taking place within the comb.

### Swarming

The process of leaving of the colony by the queen termed as swarming. It happens toward the end of spring or early summer but the real cause of swarming is still not well known.
In summers when plenty of food is availabe and hive is overcrouded by the bees, the queen leaves the hive on a fine fore-noon with some old drones and workers and establish a new colony, at some other place.
Now in the hive a worker is given Royal Jellies and is converted into a new queen of the colony. This new empress of the colony never tolrates her sucessor, as a natural law in the hive, so she orders to kill the other sisters, if any in the hive.

### Supersedure

When the egg laying capacity of the old queen is suddenly lost or it suddenly dies, a new young and vigorous queen takes the position of the old queen and is called as supersedure.

### Absconding

The migration of the complete colony from one place to another takes place due to some unfavourable condition of life, such as destruction of the comb by termites or wax-moths and scarcity of nectar producing flower round the hive. This phenomenon is quite different from that of swarming.

### Nuptial or Marriage Fight

The first swarm is led by the old queen

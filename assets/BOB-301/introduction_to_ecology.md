# Introduction to __Ecology__

Scientific study of the relationship of the living organisms with each other and with their environment.

German biologist Reiter(1868) used this term for the first time:
He introduced the term **Oekologie**

> Derived from two Greek words:
>   - ***Oikos***: home or dwelling place
>   - ***Logos***: study of


He did not give any definition.

---

**Haeckel** (1869) defined the term oekologie as:

> The study of reciprocal relations between living organisms and their environment
* Literally it means the study of organisms at home.
* Home includes the entire physical environment as well as other organisms that are there.

Later, the term oekologie was replaced by the term \'ecology\'

----

Odum (1969) defined as:
> The study of the structure and function of nature.

---

**Tansley** (1935) defines the Ecosystem \/ ecological system:
> Which involves all the living and non living factors working in a complex. He defined it as the system resulting from the integration of all living and non-living factors of the environment.

# **Ecology** and **Environmental Science**:

* *Ecology* deals with interrelationships of all organisms with their environment.
* **Environmental Science**
    * Applied Science
    * Multidisciplinary Science
    * Integrates Ecology, Geology, Zoology , Climatology, Biology , Chemistry, Environmental Economics, etc.
* Gives emphasis on analysis of human impacts on Biological, Chemical and Physical Environment of the Earth.
* It deals with the application of technical tools for solving problems faced particularly by humans.
* Ecology may be the core of Environmental Science.

# Divisions of **Plant Ecology** 
     
Autecology | Synecology
----------- | -----------
Study of **an individual** in relation to the environment. | Study of the ecology of **groups or communities** in relation to their environment.
Two Approaches of Autecological Studies- | Two Approaches of Synecological Studies-
 • Autecology of a species | • Community Ecology
• Population Ecology | • Ecosystem Approach

# Levels of **Ecological Organization**

**Species**: A group of similar organisms whose members freely interbreed with one another in the wild to produce fertile offspring.

**Population**: A group of organisms of the same species that live in the same area at the same time.

**Community**: A natural association that consists of all the populations of different species that live and interact within an area at the same time.

**Ecosystem**: A community and its physical environment.

**Landscape**: A region that includes several interacting ecosystems.

**Biosphere**: The parts of Earth’s atmosphere, ocean, land surface, and soil that contain all living organisms.

Difference between Isotopes and Radioactive Isotopes
Isobars
__THe atoms which have same mass number but different atomic number__

### Examples:
  3H </sup 3 >He  

Mirror Nuclei:
They are pairs of isobars in which the Z and N values differening by one, are interchanged.

Examples: 

## Isotones:
__Nucleus which have different atomic number and different atomic masses but the  same no. of nuteron.

Example:

 - Isotones are different element having different structure. As isotones difference in number of p they have different physical and chemical properties.

 ## Isomers:
 *Discovered by Otto Hahn*
 __Isotones




 # On the basis of nuclear stability

 1. Stable nuclides: The Nuclei which are permanent stable ( eternally stable)
  - Their p and n contents remain unchanged forever. no matter how the electrons in the outer spjhere may change in location/even in their number ( via chemkiscl reaction )
  - The nucleus of a satable nuclide can be changed only under severe condition of bombardment



  # Nuclear stability
  __A large number of factor decides the stability of nucleus.__

  1. Even-odd nature of th no. of p and n
  2. n/p reaction
  3. the nuclear potential
  4. The binding energy
  5.

## Even and odd nature of the no of p and n

Frequency distribution of stable nuclides
